<h1>About Us:</h1>
<!--About the website-->

<p>This site is currently under construction, but as things are implemented feel free to create an account and browse what we've got thus far
concerning countries, cities, and attractions.  With an account, you will eventually be able to upload pictures, comment on attractions and pictures,
and save a location as a favorite.  Don't see a country, city, or attraction you want to see here?  As a registered user you will be able to request
it to be added to our database, and then I'm sure granted no unforeseen circumstances one of us would be happy to oblige you!</p>
<p>Most of our data was collected through common knowledge, wikipedia.org, and miscellaneous travel sites. Thanks to our Mentor and Teacher Mr Shahzad Alam.  Thank you to all of our unknown contributors.</p>
